Hi, I am Yancan Chen, a CS PhD Candidate in School of Computer Science at Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU). I advise by [Yun Lin](http://linyun.info/) and [Ruofan Liu](https://lindsey98.github.io/liuruofan//). Before moving to SJTU, I obtained CS master degree at National University of Singapore (NUS School of Computing), supervised by Prof. [Yi-Chich Lee](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/cs/people/yclee/).

My interest lie in LLMs-based Multi-agent for Deep Research.

Project 
------
Medical Named Entity Recognition (NER) and Knowledge Graph Construction
* Employ Noise Embedding methods on Word Embedding of Qwen2-7B, The F1 score increases by 1 precent point.
* Employ the KTO Reinforcement Learning (RL) to improve Nested Named Entity Recognition (Nested NER)
* Qwen2 does not support the XML Tag (e.g. <person>Yancan Chen</person>) entity annotation. By training with Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning from Preferences (DPO), it can be endowed with this capability.
