Hi! I’m a PhD student at **Shanghai Jiao Tong University**. My work spans **LLM multi-agent**, **RAG for medical documents**, and **multimodal search**, with a strong interest in **AI for Science** and **social good**. I co-authored an **ACL 2025** long paper on mental-health stigma and maintain hands-on experience in large-scale systems, evaluation, and industry translation (patent filings, hospital pilots).

When I’m not debugging, I mentor students and build reproducible pipelines. Always open to collaboration—feel free to reach out.
